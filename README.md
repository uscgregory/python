### [File Transmission - Integration w/ Airplane](https://github.com/uscgregory/python/blob/main/code_sample_1.py)
This script runs within the Airplane.dev platform (hence the @airplane decorator). Airplane captures the selections from a JS React table and passes those selections as parameters to this script.  The script then retreives the appropriate files, transfers the files to our 3rd party reporting partners, and executes internal reconciliation tasks.
