# Python Code Samples

### [File Transmission - Integration w/ Airplane](https://github.com/uscgregory/python/blob/main/code_sample_1.py)
This script runs within the Airplane.dev platform (hence the @airplane decorator). Airplane captures the selections from a JS React table and passes those selections as parameters to this script.  The script then retreives the appropriate files, transfers the files to our 3rd party reporting partners, and executes internal reconciliation tasks.

### [API Call - Asynchronous with Semaphore Wrapper](https://github.com/uscgregory/python/blob/main/code_sample_2.py)
In this script we needed to make an API call to a third party application.  The API will not allow more than 10 calls at a time, so I included a semaphore wrapper that limits the number of asynchronous calls to 10 at a time. Limiting the calls to just 10 at a time synchronously would've worked as well, but with the semaphore wrapper on a synchronous API call once any of the 10 calls gets a response, another request is made (as opposed to waiting for all 10 requests to respond).  Given that there were tens of thousands of calls to make, this greatly improved the efficiency of the script.  After retreiving the information from the API, the script parses some rather large and complex XML files for use.
